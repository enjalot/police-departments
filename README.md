# List of U.S. State and Local police departments

The goal of this repository is to publish a machine-readable list of state and local police departments with basic information such as number of sworn officers as well as the city, county and state in which the department is located.

The methodology behind this data is documented in this [Observable Notebook](https://observablehq.com/@enjalot/list-of-state-and-local-law-enforcement-agencies).
